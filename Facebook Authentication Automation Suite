The code outlines a structured approach to automating the testing of Facebook's login functionality using Java, Selenium WebDriver, and Cucumber. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

Set Up the Test Runner:

The TestRunner class is configured with Cucumber options to specify the feature file's location, the glue code (step definitions), and the paths for generating various reports (HTML, JUnit, JSON).
Define Page Objects:

The LoginPojo class utilizes the Page Object Model (POM) to represent the Facebook login page elements.
It initializes web elements for the email and password input fields using @FindBy annotations.

Implement Step Definitions:

The StepDefinition class contains methods corresponding to each step in the Cucumber feature file.

Browser Initialization:
The @Given annotation method launches the Chrome browser and navigates to Facebook's login page.

Input Credentials:
The @When annotation method retrieves the email and password from an Excel sheet and inputs them into the respective fields.

Submit Login Form:
Another @When method clicks the login button to submit the form.

Validate Outcome:
The @Then annotation method checks the current URL to determine if the login was successful or if it led to an invalid credentials page.

Create Feature File:

The feature file describes the test scenario in Gherkin language, outlining the steps to validate the login functionality with valid credentials.
This structured approach ensures that the login functionality is tested efficiently, with clear separation between the test scenarios, page representations, and step implementations.
